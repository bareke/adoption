# Adoption Web Application

##### Web service for the adoption of pets

Initially it started as part of a talk about TDD/Web of the [Python Popay√°n](http://www.pythonpopayan.org/) group but due to the impact that it can generate in the future, I decided to convert it into a complete software.

## Steps required to start the application

1. It is recommended to use **Python 3.4** or higher
2. Install the packages contained in **requirements.txt** using the command installation of `pip -r requirements.txt`
3. Execute the run.py file with `python run.py`
4. Open the browser and go to the address http://localhost:5000/ or http://127.0.0.1:5000/
